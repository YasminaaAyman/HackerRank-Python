    "# Validating and Parsing Email Addresses\n",
    "A valid email address meets the following criteria:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "* It's composed of a username, domain name, and extension assembled in this format: username@domain.extension\n",
    "* The username starts with an English alphabetical character, and any subsequent characters consist of one or more of the following: [alphanumeric characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphanumeric), -,., and _.\n",
    "* The domain and extension contain only [English alphabetical characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_alphabet).\n",
    "* The extension is $1$, $2$, or $3$ characters in length.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given $n$ pairs of names and email addresses as input, print each name and email address pair having a valid email address on a new line.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** Try using [Email.utils()](https://docs.python.org/2/library/email.util.html#module-email.utils) to complete this challenge. For example, this code:<br>\n",
    "> `import email.utils`<br>\n",
    "`print email.utils.parseaddr('DOSHI <DOSHI@hackerrank.com>')`<br>\n",
    "`print email.utils.formataddr(('DOSHI', 'DOSHI@hackerrank.com'))`\n",
    "\n",
    "produces this output:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "> `('DOSHI', 'DOSHI@hackerrank.com')`<br>\n",
    "`DOSHI <DOSHI@hackerrank.com>`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input Format\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line contains a single integer, $n$, denoting the number of email address.\n",
    "Each line $i$ of the $n$ subsequent lines contains a name and an email address as two space-separated values following this format:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "> `name <user@email.com>`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "* $ 0 < n < 100 $\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output Format\n",
    "\n",
    "Print the space-separated name and email address pairs containing valid email addresses only. Each pair must be printed on a new line in the following format:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "> `name <user@email.com>`<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "You must print each valid email address in the same order as it was received as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample Input\n",
    "\n",
    "> `2`<br>\n",
    "`DEXTER <dexter@hotmail.com>`<br>\n",
    "`VIRUS <virus!@variable.:p>`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample Output\n",
    "\n",
    "> `DEXTER <dexter@hotmail.com>`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "dexter@hotmail.com is a valid email address, so we print the name and email address pair received as input on a new line.\n",
    "virus!@variable.:p is not a valid email address because the username contains an exclamation point (!) and the extension contains a colon (:). As this email is not valid, we print nothing."
